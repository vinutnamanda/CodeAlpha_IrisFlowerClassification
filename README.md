Used the Iris dataset available from `sklearn.datasets`.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📈 Model Used
- Random Forest Classifier
- Achieved accuracy: ~95–100% (varies slightly)

## 📊 Results
- Included confusion matrix
- Classification report with precision, recall, F1-score
- Visualizations using seaborn and matplotlib
